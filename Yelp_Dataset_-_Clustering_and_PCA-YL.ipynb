Thank you very much you are awesome!!! , First time eating here and the cashier was very helpful, super friendly & had a very positive attitude. She made me feel very welcome for my first time being here. Excellent customer service, delicious food & we didn't wait that long for our food. This place is a must try. We will definitely be back to try the other menu items.\n",

When getting a good bottle of wine, make sure they decant it for you...had to ask. , Had the chateau Breon and pride mountain Cabernet for dinner....wow! That was absolutely delicious food.  The tables were a little cramped and loud but still worth the trip. Pricey but still worth it.\n",

Totally worth the drive to that side of town. This restaurant is a must try. , I loved the outdoor-like square with shows and music. The food and service was excellent!\n",

Give it a try ,you won't regret it . , The food is delicious, but I wish the portions were bigger.  My humans thought there was plenty, but I never have enough food.

A couple  at my table ordered the Cesar salad for two and it was prepared table side, it looked so good! The only reason for not giving the restaurant a five star rating was the noise level.

Researched a lot of steakhouses and thought this was reasonably priced (compared to others) for Vegas so thought we'd give it a shot. made reservations but was not crowded on a Monday night. We split the bbq shrimp which were very good for an appetizer. Then we each had salads. I ordered the filet mignon which was a small 6oz serving for $50. I could've easily eaten 2 of them. But the steak was very tender and nicely seasoned. Husband had the bone in ribeye which is what they are known for. He enjoyed it. We split the mashed potatoes which were very good, but kinda hard to screw those up. We each had 1 drink and the bill was $200. Service was good. They give you nice warm rolls which were tasty. We would go back, but we like trying new places and it will probably be a few years before we go back to Vegas anyways.\""

      "Cluster 0: This was an amazing dinning experience! ORDER THE PORK CHOP! I will definitely return. , My husband and I went there for lunch on a Saturday. We had a physically exhausting week so we decided to treat ourselves. But it hasn't always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her.\r\n",
      "As we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn't say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn't feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn't make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive.\r\n",
      "Their steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn't need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive.\r\n",
      "Anyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn't get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.\n",
      "Cluster 1: Went for a nice anniversary dinner. Researched a lot of steakhouses and thought this was reasonably priced (compared to others) for Vegas so thought we'd give it a shot. made reservations but was not crowded on a Monday night. We split the bbq shrimp which were very good for an appetizer. Then we each had salads. I ordered the filet mignon which was a small 6oz serving for $50. I could've easily eaten 2 of them. But the steak was very tender and nicely seasoned. Husband had the bone in ribeye which is what they are known for. He enjoyed it. We split the mashed potatoes which were very good, but kinda hard to screw those up. We each had 1 drink and the bill was $200. Service was good. They give you nice warm rolls which were tasty. We would go back, but we like trying new places and it will probably be a few years before we go back to Vegas anyways. , My husband and I came out to Vegas for a mini vacation. Along the way he wanted to try a good steak dinner and boy we found it! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ordered the bone out ribeye and my husband ordered the Japanese Wagyu. Side dishes were the mushrooms and steak fries. 2 bottles of Syrah for drinks and banana cream pie for dessert. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everyone from the hostess to the bussers and servers were nothing short of gracious. Our server was John and he was outstanding with his wine recommendations and overall service. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our steaks were cooked perfectly, our glasses were never empty. Definitely an experience to remember. Delmonico's will be a destination for us every time we come to the city.\n",
      "Cluster 2: went for dinner tonight. Amazing my husband had lobster bisque and the T bone both were delish.I had the French onion soup and the pan seared duck. Cooked to perfection and I'm still raving about the flavor. If you are ever in Vegas this is a must try. , ABSOLUTE MUST IN VEGAS! Loved everything my boyfriend and I got and the service was amazing! Seriously this place is amazing\n",
      "Cluster 3: Hands down the best meal and service I have ever had! We all did the three course special which was great and the portions were triple the size what I thought they would be! Michael and Drew were awesome waiters and made sure everything was perfect. I know my family will talk about that night for years to come! , Good food.  Horrible service.  Had dinner in early March with a friend and the service was horrendous.  No one took are drink order for over 15 minutes even though the restaurant was only half full on a Thursday night - many people who were seated after us were already having their second drink and getting their appetizers.  Eventually after trying to get the waiters attention as he repeatedly walked by I ended up just having to get up and walk across the restaurant to have some one take our order which led to a waiter taking our drink and food order in a couple minutes....  But even then the service was lackluster and not a bit apologetic about the wait.  If you are spending $300 for dinner for two you expect decent service.  This place was a big fail.\n",
      "Cluster 4: 10/27/2016-I had my birthday dinner here and it was worth the splurge.  I have to say something about the décor - it was too plain and sterile and I expected a little more character from this establishment.  I would have added some wood paneling or some framed mirrors.  But the food was worth it.  We ordered the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp, Butternut Squash Ravioli, Traditional New Orleans Gumbo, and of course the 16 oz Rib Eye steak.  Our side dishes included the Country Smashed Potato, Delmonico Creamed Spinach, Buttered Fresh Asparagus, and Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms.  All the dishes we ordered were delicious.  Our steak was medium rare and it was sooo good.  The meat was tender with the right amount of fatty goodness.  My favorite sides were the asparagus (cooked just right, not over or under cooked) and the mushrooms.  The creamed spinach was a little too salty for me.  They added a nice touch to my birthday by serving complimentary appetizer and dessert (mango sorbet) , I ordered the filet mignon, not the best I had. Cooked right but not as tender. The sides were much better. We had the creamed corn and potatoes au gratin, my favorite. We ordered some kind of butter cake for dessert. No one at our table liked it. One of the servers overheard us talking about the cake and the waiter immediately came and took it off the tab. They do have great service and the decor is nice but with so many great restaurants in the city, I don't need to go back.\n"
